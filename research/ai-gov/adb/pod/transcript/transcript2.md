Speaker 1:  Um now we talk about a bit of a benchmarking that we did an analysis I try to be technical but as practical as possible a number of case studies then why don't you tell us a bit more about what we see as some of the recommendation next step that we need to support the department. And I think a lot of this is really about what is **immediately actionable** but also what the benchmarking tells us and and uh you know I was particularly struck by uh what the minister just shared with us at the Gen Z protests were really a declaration of values about **integrity, accountability** because this is really what what we see at also something that investors in AI are also looking for. So let's see how we can try and marry some of that up in terms of what we've done with our recommendations here. Uh we have really tried to focus on **building jobs and positioning a call as investable for growth**. AI we know is very expensive um and so how do We make sure that the pole positions itself very well. It needs to be very very investable which means those signals that we mentioned just a moment ago. Those signals are really really important. People want to see **stability and they want to see investability**. 

Speaker 1: So we're recommending here the establishment of a **national AI task force**. Now we are very well aware that there is a regulation council and that the minister launched the national AI center. We think there's a real opportunity to take this one step further by creating something that we're calling as the working title **Nepal AI commission**. Now this commission would be in in our view have very strong powers and be chaired by the minister and be very very technocratic. Now where aware as well that the the current recommendation or the current national regulation um sorry I'm just losing the name of them the AI regulation council I want to make sure I get those terms right is very heavily loaded up with career bureaucrats but there are people in there from from banking industry from other regulators as well and there's a few opportun is there for the private sector to be represented. I think there's a there there's a great opportunity here for bringing the people into a commission who can really make these things happen in a very safe and very strategic way.

Speaker 1: So we think this is an opportunity to create a **national AI task force that is a timebound enabling body** that has a mission to build a national AI commission and the AI commission would have a focus on out and outcomes namely **jobs and economic opportunities** through the creation of AI activity in in Nepal as we move into the next phase. Uh so this is a very short time frame. So 0 to 6 months is what we see for the ability to be able to do that sort of thing. And we're very conscious of course that the elections are coming up and of course that's going to cut everything that happens. Um we see an opportunity here in what we call **scaling what works**. What we want to do of course is look at how we can **build skills for the future**. So we know that there are pockets of these things that that are happening but a national plan to roll out AI skills and training initiatives can be done. 

Speaker 1: There are opportunities to partner with people from outside the pole and inside the pole who can really really make this happen. So coordinating national training initiative of across K12 focused of course on high school across TBET the technical and vocational education and training sectors and the higher education sector and not forgetting of course training for people who are already in work. So across these four areas there is an opportunity to lift skills that can position the whole prosper. We're of course aware that these things can be very lumpy and bumpy across across markets but you know it starts with creating the **right skills and creating the right opportunities** to align training efforts with needs of a future AI enabled workforce. 

Speaker 1: The second recommendation that we're suggesting here is a **one-stop shop**. We talk about investability for these very expensive AI initiatives to to come into Nepal and of course as the minister mentioned to create a climate for entrepreneurs to build AI enabled businesses in Nepal for Nepal and I think there's a great opportunity to be able to do that through something that is a one-stop shop. Regulation of course can be a great protector it can also make it very very difficult and put sand in the gears of businesses that need to move incredibly incredibly fast. It is very difficult to understate **how fast AI businesses move** and need to move in order to remain competitive on the global stage. And we think one-stop shop is is an opportunity to not just signal to the world that the pole is open for AI business but also to act as an enabler clearing some impediments out of the way. And then of course encouraging **responsible g scaling through practical guidance**. 

Speaker 1: So there are practical practices that we see around the world guidance that can be given to existing industries to enable them to take make a step change into an AI enabled world very focusing on things that are very simple, very straightforward and very practical to move and this can this can all be done in in a moderately short time frame leveraging what works in other jurisdictions. And if we move on to the third phase, this is really about **building the pole as a trusted place with skilled labor** to be able to strengthen the economy and and you know bring bring AI to the center of leaprogging integrate opportunities. So clear **human centered transparency** I I think again this aligns very much with the minister's comments that it is really about reimagining governance and creating a system where **corruption has no place**. I wrote it down. It was very important and I think this is something that we should be considering as we build these sorts of capabilities. 

Speaker 1: So how do we directly impact individuals and do it in a way that creates **strong bonding trust** in the Nepal economy based on transparency and then creating that **very stable investment friendly environment**. This doesn't always have to be about huge amounts of capital for the government. Of course, we're aware that Asian Development Bank is doing an enormous amount of work there and of course not wanting to speak for Asian Development Bank, but having you know building strengthening processes of course makes the economy much more investable. So we think The creation of the commission creates that **longitudinal policy stability** that people who are pouring the concrete and installing the service and employing people want to see in order to do those things. Um and a one-stop shop of course as a key enabler. Um then embedding **sustainability inclusion and AI literacy**. You know it is so important particularly through AI literacy and training initiatives to make sure that **everybody comes along for the ride**. You don't want to create a divided economy. 

Speaker 1: And I think there are some great opportunities with um you know very expensive and and uh you know edge models and cheap models and easier to run models that we see from around the world. Um now you know being able to be deployed to many many more people around the world, it's incumbent on us to make make sure that we can make those opportunities available for everybody across the economy out of their state of **digital literacy or digital enablement**. Uh and and of course we want to be able to embed this not just in new entrepreneurial businesses but existing businesses that that exist inside the port but we want to invest in the port. So there's an opportunity to do that. 

Speaker 1: One thing that we didn't mention here because we didn't want to crowd crowd these slides too much but it's worth mentioning that we are aware that NPole is a hydro electric powerhouse. Now one of the things that's very interesting about AI of course it can be very very energy hungry and as a net exporter of energy and some amazing hydroelect electric programs that are in train in Nepal we think there's an opportunity to build AI capacity together with the onboarding of these new hydroelect electric schemes and turn **Nepal into a green AI superpower in the region**. So there are some incredible opportunities we've outlined what we see as some the key enables based on our benchmarking and review of Nepal's AI policy. 

Speaker 1: With that just a couple of moments I'd like to just share a little bit about who we are and what we do. So **digital education council** is as I mentioned earlier a global community of practice. We are really from the education sector and very much looking at the **future of work** and and and and some of the changes that we see around the world and how do industry how do education providers and how do economies need to evolve to address some of these things to give you an idea of who some of our members are to see who really powers the sort of work that we do. Uh we are over **150 universities and colleges** are our members. Uh we are around about 2 years old, less than two years old as an organization. So we recognize that Nepal needs to move very fast. I think we understand what fast means. Um you know we're very pleased to be able to work with universities in places like the United States, Duke, Cari, Melbourne, Northeastern University, New York University, University of California, Berkeley and San Diego and lots and lots in between. In in Europe, we work with Russian group universities. We work with um big Ronda Cole in France, Seo, Ed, we work with leading business school school for management university and and literally all across the world about onethird of our members are in the Asian Pacific. 

Speaker 1: Um and we're very very much about making sure that we are a **broad church** encouraging institutions from all over the world to be part of our work. Uh we produce reports and executive briefings. This is something that we do. We are a **research shop** at our core. Um and part of what we do is evidence research that is very practical and very very usable. Uh this is this is exactly who we are and we hope we've been able to demonstrate a little bit of that to you today. Um thank you so much to the ministry. Thank you so much to the secretary and under secretary for advising us today and for Asian development bank for inviting us today.
