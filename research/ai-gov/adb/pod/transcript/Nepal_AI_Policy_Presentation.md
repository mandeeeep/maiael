## Section 1: Policy Review and Key Findings

### 1.1 Human-Centered AI Development

The AI system should be developed and deployed in a manner that aligns with **human values**, ensuring that it serves as a tool for **human empowerment** rather than replacement. When examining the policy document, several critical observations emerge regarding its comprehensive approach to AI governance.

The policy demonstrates a **clear and explicit commitment to human-centered and ethical AI** which is well-aligned with international norms. This represents a crucial and important starting point for the nation's AI journey. Furthermore, the positioning of ethics as a foundational value, coupled with a strong commitment to AI development, positions Nepal favorably compared to several comparable countries that have yet to establish such clear frameworks.

This commitment to ethics is not merely symbolic; it serves as both an enabler for innovation and a safeguard against misuse, supporting long-term responsible AI use. As the policy evolves, several key areas require attention to strengthen its implementation and impact.

### 1.2 Critical Next Steps and Identified Gaps

The analysis reveals several areas requiring focused attention moving forward. The most significant next step involves developing mechanisms to **support institutions, businesses, and individuals in practically assessing ethical principles** in their AI implementations. Additionally, clearer frameworks are needed to determine when **human oversight is specifically required** in AI systems, particularly in high-stakes applications.

The policy demonstrates considerable strength in positioning AI as a **broker to innovation**, with governance and monitoring emerging as one of the strongest areas currently. The document provides a clear definition of the starting point for a **national AI infrastructure architecture**, including the establishment of an AI Integration Council, a National AI Center, and multiple AI Centers of Excellence. The emphasis on explicit coordination and interpretation between these entities demonstrates sophisticated policy thinking.

However, gaps remain in establishing processes for incident reporting, investigation, and communication. Questions of **accountability** also require further specification, particularly given that current oversight systems remain somewhat undefined in certain contexts.

## Section 2: Pillar Analysis

### 2.1 Practical Implementation and Compliance

The policy's fourth pillar addresses practical implementation considerations that are critical for real-world effectiveness. In many countries, strong policies exist on paper, yet their impact is diminished when not effectively communicated or when overlaps and gaps create confusion between intended outcomes and actual achievements.

The **communication dimension** receives appropriate emphasis in the policy. AI deployment processes should be **transparent**, with clear mechanisms for reporting issues, challenging outcomes, and ensuring fairness across all applications. This communication infrastructure is essential for building public trust and enabling meaningful stakeholder engagement.

### 2.2 Public Engagement and Transparency

Ensuring that the people of Nepal perceive AI initiatives as active **infrastructure rather than documented government jobs** is paramount. The policy already demonstrates strong commitments to public awareness, stakeholder engagement, and coordination. The inclusion of a plan for a national communication mechanism to support AI initiatives represents a significant **enabler for growth** and positive collaboration with industry and citizens.

Gaps remain in terms of governmental obligations to disclose AI use, requiring more structured approaches to how such disclosures are presented. Additionally, establishing effective and clear channels for individuals to question, challenge, or appeal AI-related decisions across various contexts requires further development. These loops for redress and accountability represent important areas for future policy iterations.

The policy must also reflect on how AI governance introduces considerations of **new rights** and new relationships that citizens will have with AI systems, requiring forward-thinking frameworks that anticipate technological evolution.

### 2.3 Sustainable Growth and Inclusive Development

One of the policy's key strengths lies in the strong alignment between the **AI strategy and national development, inclusion, and economic growth objectives**. This represents a fundamental starting point for coherent policy implementation. The explicit attention to **marginalized groups** and ensuring equitable access to AI-enabled benefits is particularly noteworthy for a developing country context.

Moving forward, consideration should be given to developing metrics for the **environmental and social impact of AI systems**, along with mechanisms to embed sustainability considerations in employment and investment decisions. Making these considerations clear for investors and businesses will strengthen Nepal's positioning as an attractive destination for AI-related investment.

## Section 3: International Benchmarking and Lessons

### 3.1 Comparative Analysis of Global AI Policies

To contextualize Nepal's policy framework, an analysis of comparable countries provides valuable insights and actionable lessons. The following international examples demonstrate various approaches to AI policy development that may inform Nepal's ongoing implementation.

### 3.2 Bangladesh: Early-Stage Policy Excellence

Bangladesh presents a particularly relevant example given its geographic proximity and similar developmental context. The publication of their National Artificial Intelligence Policy document last year demonstrates how early-stage policy can effectively focus on **skills, infrastructure, and coordination** before moving to comprehensive regulation.

This approach highlights a crucial insight: effective AI policy in a country like Nepal must be **proportionate to national realities**. Progress can proceed hand-in-hand with regulation without overregulating before enabling innovation to flourish. The emphasis on foundational elements—skills development, infrastructure building, and institutional coordination—before elaborate regulatory frameworks represents a pragmatic path forward for emerging AI economies.

### 3.3 Rwanda: Ethics and Governance Integration

Rwanda provides an instructive example of how a relatively small country can successfully position itself as an **AI hub** in its region. The publication of their AI policy document in 2023 demonstrates how ethics, skills development, and governance can be integrated effectively within a coherent national framework.

This integration is particularly relevant for Nepal, as Rwanda has demonstrated that comprehensive AI policy need not be the exclusive domain of wealthy, technologically advanced nations. The successful synthesis of ethical considerations, capacity building, and governance structures offers a template that can be adapted to Nepal's specific context and developmental stage.

### 3.4 Sri Lanka: Adaptive Governance Framework

Sri Lanka published its national AI strategy in 2024, establishing a framework to **accelerate responsible AI adoption** while supporting global capacity building and aligning AI initiatives with national development goals. The Sri Lankan example highlights how **adaptive governance and AI literacy development** can progress together.

This merging of literacy development with adaptive governance represents a key trend observed across similar countries. The recognition that AI literacy must accompany regulatory development, rather than follow it, demonstrates sophisticated policy design that anticipates implementation challenges and builds capacity alongside regulatory frameworks.

### 3.5 Ghana: Signaling and Long-Term Planning

Ghana offers a particularly valuable example for understanding how a country with **limited resources** can effectively leverage AI policy for economic transformation. The case demonstrates how **long-term planning, skills pipeline development, and signaling stability to investors** can be instrumental in attracting investment and building AI capacity.

**Signaling to the economy and investors** represents one of the key enablers for ensuring AI policies do not remain as aspirational documents but instead catalyze innovation and investment. This signaling function is crucial for Nepal's aspirations to position itself as an attractive destination for AI-related development and investment.

## Section 4: Strategic Recommendations

### 4.1 Establishing a National AI Task Force

The primary recommendation is the establishment of a **National AI Task Force**. While the AI Regulation Council has been launched and the National AI Center established, there is a significant opportunity to advance this agenda further through the creation of what might be termed the **Nepal AI Commission**.

This commission should possess strong powers and be chaired at the ministerial level with a highly technocratic composition. The current AI Regulation Council, while valuable, is heavily populated with career bureaucrats. While representatives from the banking industry and other regulators participate, there are opportunities for greater private sector representation and engagement.

The proposed Task Force should be a **time-bound enabling body** with a mission to build toward a permanent AI Commission. The Commission's focus should be on outcomes—specifically **jobs and economic opportunities** through the creation of AI activity in Nepal. A timeframe of zero to six months is recommended for establishing this foundational structure, acknowledging the upcoming electoral cycle and the need to capitalize on current momentum.

### 4.2 Scaling Skills Development

A national approach to **building skills for the future** represents a critical priority. While pockets of AI skills development initiatives exist across Nepal, a coordinated national plan to roll out AI skills and training initiatives is needed. The opportunity exists to partner with organizations and individuals who can accelerate this development.

The recommended approach encompasses four key areas: **K-12 education** focusing on high school-level AI literacy; **Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET)** sectors; **Higher Education** institutions; and **Continuing Education** for those already in the workforce. Coordinating national training initiatives across these four areas presents an opportunity to elevate skills comprehensively and position Nepal for AI-enabled prosperity.

Recognizing that these initiatives can be uneven across different markets, the starting point must be creating the **right skills and opportunities** to align training efforts with the needs of a future AI-enabled workforce.

### 4.3 Creating a One-Stop Shop for AI Business

Given that AI initiatives require substantial investment, creating a **one-stop shop** for AI business development in Nepal is essential. As noted by the Minister, creating an enabling climate for entrepreneurs to build AI-enabled businesses in Nepal—businesses serving both Nepal and global markets—represents a significant opportunity.

AI businesses move at extraordinary speed to remain competitive globally. Regulation, while serving important protective functions, can create barriers that impede business development. A one-stop shop serves both to **signal to the world that Nepal is open for AI business** and to act as an enabler by removing impediments to responsible scaling.

Practical guidance should be provided to existing industries to enable their transition to an AI-enabled future, focusing on simple, straightforward, and practical implementation steps. This can be accomplished within a moderate timeframe by leveraging approaches that have proven effective in other jurisdictions.

### 4.4 Building Trust Through Transparency

The third phase of implementation should focus on **building Nepal as a trusted location with skilled labor** to strengthen the economy and bring AI to the center of leapfrogging opportunities. Clear **human-centered transparency** aligns with ministerial comments about reimagining governance and creating systems where corruption has no place.

Creating **strong bonding trust** in the Nepal economy based on transparency will establish a **stable, investment-friendly environment**. While this does not always require substantial government capital investment, strengthening processes makes the economy significantly more investable. The creation of the proposed Commission would establish the **longitudinal policy stability** that investors, businesses, and developers require before committing resources.

### 4.5 Embedding Sustainability and Inclusion

Embedding **sustainability, inclusion, and AI literacy** throughout the policy framework is essential. AI literacy and training initiatives must ensure that **everybody benefits** from the AI transformation. Creating a divided economy—where only some segments benefit from AI advancement—would undermine both equity and long-term economic potential.

The opportunities are significant given the availability of both expensive and more accessible AI models that can be deployed more broadly. Ensuring that these opportunities are available across the economy, regardless of current **digital literacy or digital enablement levels**, represents both a challenge and an opportunity. This should extend not only to new entrepreneurial businesses but also to existing businesses seeking to benefit from AI integration.

### 4.6 Green AI Superpower Potential

An important opportunity not emphasized in the primary policy document relates to Nepal's energy potential. Nepal's status as a **hydropower powerhouse** presents unique opportunities given that AI systems can be highly energy-intensive. With ongoing hydroelectric development programs, Nepal has the opportunity to build AI capacity alongside new hydroelectric schemes and position itself as a **green AI superpower in the region**.

This strategic positioning combines Nepal's natural advantages with the growing global emphasis on sustainable technology development, creating a distinctive value proposition for environmentally conscious AI development and deployment.

## Section 5: About the Digital Education Council

The Digital Education Council is a **global community of practice** focused on the **future of work** and how economies, industry, and education providers must evolve to address technological changes. With over **150 universities and colleges** as members and less than two years of operation, the organization brings practical global perspectives to local challenges.

The Council's membership includes universities across the United States (Duke, Carnegie Mellon, Melbourne, Northeastern University, New York University, University of California Berkeley, and San Diego), Europe (including leading institutions in France and the UK), and globally, with approximately one-third of members in the Asia-Pacific region.

As a **research organization** at its core, the Council produces reports and executive briefings based on practical, evidence-based research. This approach emphasizes usability and actionability, principles that have guided the development of the recommendations presented in this analysis.

## Section 6: Discussion and Q&A Highlights

### 6.1 Gender Considerations in AI Development

**Question**: Women have not been specifically mentioned in the policy. What effective strategies could be employed to bring women into AI development?

**Response**: The impediments for women entering the IT industry are significant and well-documented. Key enablers for women include **reliable internet access at home**, including robust 4G and 5G connectivity, enabling women to access opportunities regardless of location. Access to **affordable devices** is equally important. Societal challenges around biases, while not unique to the IT industry, are exacerbated by the industry's male-dominated nature.

Practical measures include rolling out fiber infrastructure, implementing initiatives like Starlink, and providing subsidized access to connectivity. Additionally, specific educational training opportunities for women should be developed and promoted.

### 6.2 Success Stories and Investor Confidence

**Question**: We need clarity and confidence for investors. Success stories from other countries seem distant from Nepal's context. What realistic examples can Nepal follow?

**Response**: Singapore and Hong Kong provide instructive examples despite their different contexts. Both are relatively small countries that have excelled by recognizing that their AI policies must address markets far beyond their borders.

Singapore has positioned itself as an **enabler and trusted partner** for the broader region—serving not just its 6.5 million residents but the hundreds of millions of people in neighboring countries. This positioning makes Singapore an attractive location for data centers, technology companies, and supporting professional services.

For Nepal, supporting clients and investors in understanding **how AI can be deployed responsibly** represents a significant opportunity. The development of industry associations, modeled on examples like the Fintech Association of Hong Kong, could serve to bring together stakeholders and support market development. AI Singapore has also demonstrated effective work as a connector between innovative use cases and industry.

### 6.3 Transparency, Ethics, and Democratic Values

**Question**: There is a gap in Nepal regarding transparency, AI ethical norms, and democratic values. This needs explicit emphasis to ensure proper guardrails are established.

**Response**: The concern is valid and important. **Sustainable and transparent policy settings** are enablers but must be balanced with local context—relevant for the whole while not creating unnecessary impediments. Once established, these frameworks need to be stable and accompanied by **transparent oversight** to ensure rules are fairly applied to all.

The focus should be on **practical guidance** because transparency and accountability concepts, while well-understood in theory, often leave practitioners uncertain about practical implementation. Questions like "What constitutes transparency?" and "How do we demonstrate it?" need clear answers.

The Digital Education Council has published an **AI Governance Framework** providing practical structures institutions can use. For Nepal, developing simple guidance documents on what communications should accompany AI systems—helping users understand data processing and system behavior—would be valuable. This practical, actionable guidance is especially important for developing countries beginning their AI journey.

### 6.4 Operationalizing Governance and Sustainability

**Question**: Governance is identified as a strength, while sustainability is described as aspirational rather than operational. How can recommendations transform policy from aspirational to operational, enabling Nepal to capitalize on the AI opportunity window and achieve green AI superpower status?

**Response**: The identified gaps in an early-stage environment are elements requiring continued development to strengthen the policy's foundation. Regarding governance, while the framing is strong, practical implementation guidance is needed.

The recommendation is for **light-touch guidance** to support responsible use. This involves two parallel approaches: supporting **low-risk use cases** (productivity tools, simple analytics, research tools that do not deal with sensitive data) to create an easy experimentation environment; and encouraging **early identification of high-impact or high-risk use cases** to enable appropriate safeguards over time.

A **progressive, phased approach** helps people understand different risk levels without imposing burdens that prevent business operation and growth. Building a **national picture of AI activity**—identifying, referencing, and showcasing use cases between public, private, and education sectors—creates best practices and demonstrates Nepal's capabilities.

The communication element is critical: showing what is happening in Nepal, demonstrating that Nepal is a stable place for investors and entrepreneurs, and making clear what risks to track and how to respond. The stable environment message is essential—investment is required for AI to grow, and countries attempting to build national AI champions without this foundation quickly discover the challenges.

Rapid adoption of **global standards** positions Nepal favorably for participation in global AI markets.

### 6.5 Education-Industry Alignment

**Question**: Neither academia nor industry in Nepal has sufficient investment in time to create the workforce needed for the AI era. What are other countries doing, and what key lessons can Nepal's industry and economy apply?

**Response**: This represents a significant challenge across all markets. In countries underserved by education, there is a real risk of falling behind. The opportunity exists for existing education providers to leverage existing intellectual property and global partnerships.

AI literacy training through university partnerships can address one segment of the market. Ministries and industry associations can link those already doing this work globally to spin up initiatives quickly. While challenges exist, it is important to recognize that in comparable countries, **AI literacy is at the core** of national AI strategies.

Simple actions can lead to disproportionate outcomes. Focusing on **fundamental skills for everyone** with maximum reach and minimum time investment, followed by more complex engineering skills, represents a pragmatic approach. Identifying **quick wins and practical outcomes** that can be built upon creates momentum for broader transformation.
