Speaker 1: Please stay on the line because we'll be taking a few questions from the audience. Um everyone please if you have any questions my colleagues are here to pass the mic around.

Speaker 2: In your presentation **woman has not been specifically mentioned** yesterday. Yeah. So even in our policy also so what would be such an effective way to bring women into our SP maybe you can see some of your studies and the strategy that you are working.

Speaker 1: Thank you so much and we really appreciate the question. I think this is such an important issue because we know the **impediments for women to get into the IT industry**. Um if if it helps and I know this is not really a contextual example, my wife is leads cyber security training at at one of the global banks here based here in Singapore and I think you know she always tells me about some of the massive impediments in that industry for women and that's in a in a in a developed market context. I think you know there's we we haven't focused specifically on women or men in this but I think as we look at and drill down and start to create policies for **equitable and inclusive enablement**, I think women is is one of the core groups that has an opportunity huge opportunity. When we look around the world, one of the key enablers for that women, you know, usually have to work twice as hard as men to do just about anything because rightly or wrongly the the the work at home is is is predominantly the burden that is taken by women as well as having to do a full-time or part-time job as well. So, a key enabler is **really good internet access** particularly at home, really good 4G, 5G access. So, wherever they are, they have access to opportunities and and being able to have access to affordable affordable devices. They are key enablers. Um some of the other challenges that are societal that are based around biases. Uh you know it's not unique to the IT industry. Um I think that it is unfortunately exacerbated by our industry being very male dominated. Those key enablers remain you know for women to be able to work and deal with you know their unfair share of the household burden means being able to do their work when and where and and as they need to be able to do that and that requires very very good internet access. So roll out of fiber, roll out of initiatives like **Starling** you know and and and subsidized access to that sort of thing or you know other incentives to enable that I think is a really strong start. Um and then of course we can look at other initiatives like specific educational training opportunities for women I think would be to work with you on some of those things. 

Speaker 2: Uh thank you both very president of AI association. We talked about the need clarity and confidence to and investors. **Success stories** of any countries there are but I think there's might be a little bit too too far away.

Speaker 1: I mean that that's really what **Singapore** does and does exceptionally well that it is a developed it is a developed market. I think of course you know they recognize as they usually have nothing except their investability.

Speaker 2: Go on, sorry.

Speaker 1: No, I I think actually in a way the Singapore and Hong Kong example, they're very interesting and why they're very interesting because they are while of course they differ for obvious reasons to context of Nepal. We are talking about relatively speaking small countries in dimension and what is also interesting is that besides the the the the the specifics of the country. We also need to realize that we are talking about the industry that is very understated and the impact that is very not clear and so a super opportunity for Nepal could be really the one of supporting clients for investors in terms of **how AI can support the company and can was being deployed responsibly**. A couple of examples that I think especially for Singapore is what was done in both context when the **fintech revolution** started. And so we look at how fintech was something very new at the time and both countries really buy also the associations. I think also the the fintech association of Hong Kong is an interesting example by really what they produce. that type of work with the facilitators and so really thinking of how the for example the love to know more about what what you're thinking and what you are working on but how the **association of Nepal could be also an actor** to support to bring together people and to support the client into the market and so by really convenient people and being aware of the market and also being participator in supporting literacy. This is really something that an association and we have seen such examples in both Singapore and Hong Kong specifically in the fintech context. 

Speaker 1: So these are two examples that we are seeing a lot. Uh in terms of the associations actually the association of Hong Kong is also very active. So it's one that I want to reference as well. Um in Singapore **AI Singapore** has been working tremendously well in support of a of a of a trade on a connector between innovative use cases and the industry and I think also in this case for for this type of players it's also important how we can support large companies or traditional companies let's say in understanding what AI can do and cannot do because very often this is where many pilots fails because of failing in defining the use case and impact and so how can we support this type of is really really important. So these are a few examples I will mention even if they come from developed places the structure and the way they develop their practices is really interesting and something for sure that can be your inspiration for the health. 

Speaker 2: Thank you. Thank you. My name is Vivek Rana. I teach this subject called **strategy and AI at Kathmandu University School of Management**. your recommendations are very valid and there is one particular area that I think that we lack in Nepal and we've not been very productive about it is the **transparency AI ethical norms and democratic values**. Uh I feel that that is probably understood but I believe that needs to be explicitly mentioned so that we stand at equal pudding. I always viewed AI as a two-edged sword and if we don't build the right guard rails, if we do not have the right emphasis on these values part further out, we may lose out lose out on a lot of important aspects. I think that is one area that we need to be very careful of and since both of you are coming coming from Europe, I think that you would appreciate these comments. 

Speaker 1: I'm not from Europe, but that's okay. **I'm from Australia**. Um the the opposite. I I think that I think they're really valid comments. Thank you so much for that because I think the there's a and what I've tried to do um in the review of the national policy is really juapose how **sustainable and transparent policy setting are an enabler**, but they must be balanced with the local context. So, they must make sure that they're relevant for the whole, but they must also make sure they're not an impediment. So, it's it's a it's a balance it's a very careful balancing act. Um, and then of course once you finally get that in place, you want it to be nice and stable. Um, and you need to have **transparent oversight** to make sure that the rules are being fairly applied to everybody. I think back to Alli's um comments earlier about the the Singapore and Hong Kong model that that's actually what they've done really well. Um and again, you know, if you look at if you look at Singapore, for example, where we are, it's a very very small country, 6 and a half million people in a sea of billions. Um you know, and and so what Singapore has done very well is being an enabler of or a center where good things can happen for those around them. So it's not really about servicing so much our small 6.5 million person market. It's about the 100 million in China, the 70 million in Malaysia, the 70 million in Thailand. Uh you know the the 100 million in the Philippines, the 100 million in Vietnam. Um being the **enabler and a trusted partner** means it's a really good place to put your data centers, a really good place to put your coders, your companies you know your lawyers all the enables that that that make these things happen for the entire region. 

Speaker 1: So, uh you know, I I I hope that message got got across pretty clearly that that's that's sort of really where we see a golden opportunity. Just quickly to add also and this is part of the the recommendations that we we present. The focus should be on **practical guidance**. Very often we see that actually transparency and accountability gets a bit lost in the way because while they are fairly understood and achievable concepts very often we do see that people instill solutions companies they struggle to understand pract okay so what do we do how do we understand what is transparent what is not and so a few last year we also published our **AI governance framework** that looks at practically u structures that institutions in governance can use for this and And it's been really interesting to reflect on how we support transparency. And so we should look at practical simple guidance on okay when we implement a system what type of simple communications we should present to make our users understand what we are doing and how we're processing this data. And so for the ability for the possibility for the government of Nepal really support institutions people with simple guidance documents to help them understand what simple questions to ask and this is very important in the context of also developing countries who starting this journey to make it very clear and actionable so people can progress and we build on we'll take one final question from Mr. and thanks and for your wonderful review um analysis and review of the policy.
