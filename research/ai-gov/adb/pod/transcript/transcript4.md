Speaker 2: Um at one point of time I think with AI ethics and technology on my particular job but the gaps that you said is the strength is the governance is one of the strong area of this policy and on the gap trying to say that you know but and then to the other gap we say you know uh the sustainability is aspirational rather than you know operational and we have seen this we said and changes that we have seen. So you know these both gaps kind of u you know refer to a scenario where AI is aspirational but on the operational it might have issues. So what could be you know as an academician as an industry as in um the use cases that you have referred what could be the you know most travel recommendations which could actually transform this strengthen the governance to operational sustainability of AI policy and as we said how AI can be an economic irregular so that we can you know take the benefit of the window of opportunity that AI brings in and also we reach a kind of as we said you know green AI super power you know how how we move on that so thank you. 

Speaker 1: I'll be I need to start especially on what you mentioned around the governance and sustainability naturally for us when when we highlight the gaps is also important to reflect how it's as mentioned it's an **early stage environment** and so it's it's an element of to work on that could make this this good starting point stronger and so for us when we look at governance it refers specifically to the fact and start great in points out the framing of the governance but going forward of strong recommendation. We mention that the um ling the differentiate risks but also practically like people these use cases. It is very important. What we do not recommend is to spend a lot of time in structure very difficult to manage these classifications that would risk to increase the economy and so the what we really envision and what we recommend is a **light touch guidance** to support responsible use. So partly on one side is how can you support **low-risk use cases** for example productivity tools simple analytics simple research tools do not deal with sensitive data so that you make it easier for people people and businesses to experiment and create an easy to manage experimentation environment. On the other side, how can you encourage **early identification of high impact or high risk use cases** so that you can map this and start to safeguard people over time and this is really important as also we move to you know the next phases. 

Speaker 1: How can you evolve of these so that the support mechanisms and the guidance documents are very clear. So we really ensision the type of **progressive phase basis** to make sure that people understand the different risks but without providing the people to lower the burden for people so that the businesses cannot operate cannot grow and that will be a bit challenging in terms of the how to put also Nepal more on the map of this it's The first phase there was also an important point about build a **national picture for AI activity**. And so how can Nepal support AI use cases to be identified to be referenced to be showcased between public private and the education sector as well and how these use cases can also be a bit of best practices that can be referenced and so it's important the communication element is really really important to show what is happening in Nepal and that as many was mentioning Nepal is also a stable place for investors for entrepreneurs to try and so it's how can you make it clear and actionable for people to understand the different risks that are involved with the island and also the okay so what do you need to track and what do you do when you once you identify this risk and how it is a stable environment to to to do innovation. These three element are really the most important ones. I don't know that if there's anything else you would like to mention especially on the um doing best to start. 

Speaker 1: Yeah. No, I think I I mean this stable environment I think everyone I think everyone got the message. Um but you know really in terms of there was one enabler that u you know make sure that the place is investable. And it really does require investment for AI to grow. I don't think that countries where they have tried to build national AI champions and build out the robots and those sorts of things, they find out very quickly they're very expensive and they don't deliver those sorts of economic benefits. So you know that's why we encourage the **rapid adoption of global standards to the global market**. 

Speaker 2: Hello. Um I'm Ankur Sharma. I'm director of innovation at one IT service company here in so my question is about the education sector and academics that's the whole industrial workforce input. So in our scenario neither academics nor industry have the investment in time to like create the kind of workforce that we need to create for the upcoming knowledge just catching up to the AI waves both on the skill or engineering center as well as humanities and psychology and other center as well. So I just want to hear from you because like you have a collaboration with lot of universities around the world what what is changing scenario and how countries like ours investment in in the low are coping with this and what are the key that we can have that our industry and specifically our economies can take from.

Speaker 1: I sorry I think thank you very much for that I think it's you're right it's it's a big challenge and we know that in markets where they're unserved by education that that they will literally fall behind and and this is a key challenge I'm sure as as as an important IT services firm inventory that you're probably suffering from the same challenge that everybody else is in terms of finding good and job ready workers. I think there's there's a great opportunity really for existing education providers like we cut university to perhaps leverage ex existing intellectual property that's out there you know just for our part we we work with the universities around the world to deliver **AI literacy training** because they're struggling with it we know this firsthand so there's an opportunity there but of course that that addresses only one very small part of the market I think there's certainly an opportunity for ministries for industry associations to link up people who already do this sort of thing around the world to be able to spin up initiatives and turn them on very very quickly and and so you know I mean we're happy to to point people in the right directions or or do what we can ourselves and do it you know there's got to be ways where it can be done in ways that's very very yeah there you go to add yeah is very important he. 

Speaker 1: So while of course we recognize that there are challenges, it is important that as we see also in comparable countries, **AI literacy is at the core**. And so as Denny mentioned, we are actually working with a number of of of institutions and and and governance look at this problem. And it is important to start it is important to start. It is important to recognize also that simple actions and quick actions both lead to very important disproportionate outcomes. Sometimes it is important really to reflect on what is what are some fundamental skills for everyone to learn and how we can impact them in the biggest number possible and in the shortest time and then we can look at the more complicated type of engineering skills which of course it is an element but it's important to reflect what we can do in the short term and identify also **quick wins and practical outcomes** that we can shortly to build on top really to go back what we see before practice the type of national amission that we clearly see. So u it's while there are naturally concentrated resources it is important to start and and very practically and very effective.
